## TODOs
- Fix clipboard functionality for cross platform
- Fix functionality for inputBox callback function
- Add "isChanged" as box variable to say if the box size is changed (FORMAT LINES)
- FIX EDGE CONDITIONS
- Scroll icon on the side of the box? Some sort of relation with scrollIndex to indicate where it is
